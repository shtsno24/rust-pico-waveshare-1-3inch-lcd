# Using Waveshare 1.3" LCD Module for Raspberry Pi Pico with Rust

This project is for controlling an [LCD module(using ST7789)](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-LCD-1.3) for a Raspberry Pi Pico using Rust.  
The code is primitive, so not much can be done with it, but we were able to actually control the screen using Rust.
